# Jumper

###### by Team Pisco-Sour

## Game Rules
The purpose of the game is to collect as much coins as you can.You have to be good at jumping,
because there are obstacles like spikes and pits. Spikes will kill you slowly in agony and falling in a pit will lead you to instant death by 1000 degrees mortal lava.
The game level finishes when you reach the end of the path.
